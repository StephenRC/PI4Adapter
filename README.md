# PI4Adapter
PI3 or PI4 to Duet 3

Duet 3 Mini 5+ mount directly on it with the board hanging off the side,  5vdc required.

Deut 3 6HC, mount of the board, needs a extension to the 26 pin socket to get the board high enough.  PI4 requires external 5vdc.

The JST-XH is for addons, like the official PI Touchscreen

2/26/22: USB C connector not tested.
